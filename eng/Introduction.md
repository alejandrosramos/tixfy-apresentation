# Introduction
The Tixfy app aims to provide users with a seamless and efficient ticket-buying experience for various events. To ensure a high level of user satisfaction and increase the app's market success, it is important to conduct a pre-analysis of user experience. This document outlines the steps involved in conducting a pre-analysis and highlights the significance of statistical inference in this process. Additionally, Python will be used to create visualizations that enhance the analysis.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

  <img src="../assets/tixfy-demo.gif" alt="tixfy presatation"   width="478" height="789">

The Tixfy app is designed with a user-centric approach, aiming to simplify the ticket-buying process for users. However, before launching the app to the public, it is essential to conduct a pre-analysis of user experience to identify and address any performance or usability issues. This pre-analysis involves various steps to ensure an optimal user experience.

# The Roadmap to Success: Essential Steps for Conducting this UX Research

## Step 1: Define Objectives

In this step, the objectives of the UX survey are clearly stated. The primary goal is to identify potential problems and improve the usability of the application. Collaborating with other Tixfy team members can help define these objectives effectively.


## Step 2: Test Participant Selection

To gather diverse feedback, a group of testers is selected. This group should include 10 tech-savvy individuals and 10 people with varying levels of familiarity with technology. Considering demographic factors like age, gender, educational background, and technology familiarity helps ensure a well-rounded sample.


## Step 3: Test Execution

Testers are provided with the Tixfy app and their interactions are observed without giving specific instructions. Testers are encouraged to think aloud and express their thoughts while exploring the app. Usability issues, confusion, or difficulties encountered by the testers are noted.


## Step 4: Post-Test Questionnaire

A questionnaire is designed to gather feedback on the usability experience. This questionnaire should include around 10 questions covering aspects such as ease of use, navigation, clarity of information, and overall satisfaction. A rating scale, such as 1 to 5 stars, can be used for quantitative feedback.



## Step 5: Additional Data Collection
 
Demographic information about the testers, including age, gender, educational background, and familiarity with technology, is collected. Prior experience with ticket-buying applications can also be captured.



## Step 6: Data Analysis

Collected data is aggregated and analyzed using Python and the Pandas library. Average ratings for each question are calculated to determine overall satisfaction levels. The feedback from different user segments can be compared to identify patterns or differences in usability experiences. Demographic data is analyzed alongside usability feedback to find correlations or insights specific to certain user groups.



## Step 7: Identifying Areas for Improvement

Recurring themes, common pain points, or areas with low ratings are identified to determine specific aspects of the application that need improvement. Both qualitative feedback (comments, suggestions) and quantitative ratings are considered to prioritize areas for enhancement.

## Step 8: Iterative Design

Improvements are made to the application based on the insights gained from the UX survey. Usability issues are addressed, the user interface is refined, and the overall user experience is enhanced. Additional rounds of testing can be conducted to validate the effectiveness of the design changes.


## Step 9: Enhancing the Overall Average

The average ratings from the testers' responses are used to identify the lowest score. The goal is to increase the lowest score to at least the average, aiming to improve the overall average satisfaction rating.

By following these steps, the pre-analysis of user experience helps ensure a high level of user satisfaction, identify and fix issues, and increase the market success of the Tixfy app.


# Statistical Inference in Pre-Analysis

Statistical inference plays a crucial role in the pre-analysis of user experience. It allows us to draw meaningful conclusions and make data-driven decisions based on the collected data. In the context of the Tixfy app, statistical inference helps us:

* __Identify Significant Differences__: By conducting statistical tests, we can determine if there are significant differences in the usability experience between user segments or specific aspects of the application. For example, we can compare the ratings between tech-savvy individuals and those less familiar with technology to identify any notable differences.

* __Make Data-Driven Decisions__: Statistical inference enables us to make informed decisions based on the data. For instance, if the statistical analysis reveals that a particular aspect of the app has a significantly lower rating, we can prioritize the improvement of that aspect to enhance the overall user experience.

* __Quantify Uncertainty__: Statistical inference provides measures of uncertainty, such as confidence intervals and p-values. These measures help us understand the reliability of our findings and assess the statistical significance of any observed differences. This information guides us in determining the level of confidence we can have in our conclusions.

Python and its various libraries, such as Pandas and Matplotlib, can be leveraged to perform statistical inference and visualize the results. Using Python, we can conduct hypothesis tests, calculate confidence intervals, and create charts to present the findings in a clear and visually appealing manner.

# Benefits: By following the provided guidelines and conducting the pre-analysis of user experience, you can expect to gain the following benefits:

* a. Improved Usability: Gathering feedback from users and analyzing their experiences will aid in identifying areas for enhancement in the app's usability. This can result in a more user-friendly and intuitive application.

* b. Enhanced User Satisfaction: By addressing usability issues and incorporating user feedback, you can heighten user satisfaction with the app. This can lead to increased engagement, positive reviews, and improved market success.

* c. Data-Driven Decision Making: By leveraging statistical inference and data analysis, you can make well-informed decisions based on objective findings. This enables you to prioritize improvements and allocate resources effectively.

* d. Iterative Improvement: The iterative design approach outlined in the provided documentation enables continuous refinement of the app. By incorporating user feedback and conducting subsequent rounds of testing, you can enhance the app's features, design, and user experience over time.

* e. Clear Communication and Collaboration: The documentation serves as a communication tool for your team and stakeholders. It ensures that all parties understand the objectives, steps, and significance of the pre-analysis process. This promotes effective collaboration and alignment among team members.

* f. Documented Process: The documentation serves as a record of the user experience analysis process. It can be utilized as a reference for future projects or shared with others who can benefit from your insights and approach.
