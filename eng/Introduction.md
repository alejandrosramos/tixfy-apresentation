## About The Project

  <img src="../assets/tixfy-demo.gif" alt="tixfy presatation"   width="478" height="789">

The Tixfy app is designed with a user-centric approach, aiming to simplify the ticket-buying process for users. However, before launching the app to the public, it is essential to conduct a pre-analysis of user experience to identify and address any performance or usability issues. This pre-analysis involves various steps to ensure an optimal user experience.

# The Roadmap to Success: Essential Steps for Conducting this UX Research

## Step 1: Define Objectives

In this step, the objectives of the UX survey are clearly stated. The primary goal is to identify potential problems and improve the usability of the application. Collaborating with other Tixfy team members can help define these objectives effectively.


## Step 2: Test Participant Selection

To gather diverse feedback, a group of testers is selected. This group should include 10 tech-savvy individuals and 10 people with varying levels of familiarity with technology. Considering demographic factors like age, gender, educational background, and technology familiarity helps ensure a well-rounded sample.


## Step 3: Test Execution

Testers are provided with the Tixfy app and their interactions are observed without giving specific instructions. Testers are encouraged to think aloud and express their thoughts while exploring the app. Usability issues, confusion, or difficulties encountered by the testers are noted.


## Step 4: Post-Test Questionnaire

A post-test questionnaire will be used to gather feedback on the usability experience. It will consist of approximately 10 questions per screen/task, covering aspects such as ease of use, navigation, clarity of information, and overall satisfaction. Users will rate their experience using a scale, typically ranging from 1 to 5 stars, providing quantitative feedback.

The questionnaire aims to capture valuable insights into the user's perception of the app's usability and their overall satisfaction. This feedback, combined with user recordings, allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the app's strengths and areas for improvement. It enables us to make informed decisions and enhancements to deliver an exceptional user experience.



## Step 5: Additional Data Collection
 
Demographic information about the testers, including age, gender, educational background, and familiarity with technology, is collected. Prior experience with ticket-buying applications can also be captured.



## Step 6: Data Analysis

Collected data is aggregated and analyzed using Python and the Pandas library. Average ratings for each question are calculated to determine overall satisfaction levels. The feedback from different user segments can be compared to identify patterns or differences in usability experiences. Demographic data is analyzed alongside usability feedback to find correlations or insights specific to certain user groups.



## Step 7: Identifying Areas for Improvement

Recurring themes, common pain points, or areas with low ratings are identified to determine specific aspects of the application that need improvement. Both qualitative feedback (comments, suggestions) and quantitative ratings are considered to prioritize areas for enhancement.

## Step 8: Iterative Design

Improvements are made to the application based on the insights gained from the UX survey. Usability issues are addressed, the user interface is refined, and the overall user experience is enhanced. Additional rounds of testing can be conducted to validate the effectiveness of the design changes.


## Step 9: Enhancing the Overall Average

The average ratings from the testers' responses are used to identify the lowest score. The goal is to increase the lowest score to at least the average, aiming to improve the overall average satisfaction rating.

By following these steps, the pre-analysis of user experience helps ensure a high level of user satisfaction, identify and fix issues, and increase the market success of the Tixfy app.


# Statistical Inference in Pre-Analysis

Statistical inference plays a crucial role in the pre-analysis of user experience. It allows us to draw meaningful conclusions and make data-driven decisions based on the collected data. In the context of the Tixfy app, statistical inference helps us:

* __Identify Significant Differences__: By conducting statistical tests, we can determine if there are significant differences in the usability experience between user segments or specific aspects of the application. For example, we can compare the ratings between tech-savvy individuals and those less familiar with technology to identify any notable differences.

* __Make Data-Driven Decisions__: Statistical inference enables us to make informed decisions based on the data. For instance, if the statistical analysis reveals that a particular aspect of the app has a significantly lower rating, we can prioritize the improvement of that aspect to enhance the overall user experience.

* __Quantify Uncertainty__: Statistical inference provides measures of uncertainty, such as confidence intervals and p-values. These measures help us understand the reliability of our findings and assess the statistical significance of any observed differences. This information guides us in determining the level of confidence we can have in our conclusions.

Python and its various libraries, such as Pandas and Matplotlib, can be leveraged to perform statistical inference and visualize the results. Using Python, we can conduct hypothesis tests, calculate confidence intervals, and create charts to present the findings in a clear and visually appealing manner.

# Benefits: By following the provided guidelines and conducting the pre-analysis of user experience, you can expect to gain the following benefits:

# Practice (HANDS ON)
### Step 1: Define Objectives

During an in-depth conversation with Rafael, our Designer/PO/UX/UI, we explored the research methodology for this project. It has been determined that the initial approach will involve conducting a qualitative study to gather insights. 

* __Understanding user needs:__ Qualitative research helps uncover the underlying needs and pain points of users, providing a deep understanding of their motivations, expectations, and challenges.

* __Uncovering insights:__ Qualitative research gathers rich, detailed insights that may not be captured by quantitative methods alone, revealing user behaviors, preferences, and attitudes.

* __Iterative design process:__ Involving users early in the design process, qualitative research allows for iterative feedback and refinement of ideas, identifying potential issues or areas for improvement.

* __Identifying usability issues:__ Through methods like usability testing and observations, qualitative research identifies usability issues or barriers, helping to improve the user experience and ensure usability.

* __Competitive advantage:__ Qualitative user research provides a competitive advantage by understanding the target audience, creating products or services that resonate with users, enhancing customer satisfaction, engagement, and business outcomes.



### Step 2: Test Participant Selection
The user testing phase will include three distinct user profiles:

* __Technologically Proficient Users:__ Six individuals who are highly experienced and knowledgeable in technology.
* __Moderately Familiar Users:__ Six individuals with some familiarity and understanding of technology.
* __Technologically Novice Users:__ Six individuals with limited to no technological literacy.


### Step 3: Test Execution
During the test execution phase, it is essential to create an environment that promotes natural and independent user interaction with the application. Here's how you can enhance the process:

* __Minimal interference:__ Ensure that user testers can explore the application with minimal interference and guidance from the interviewer. This allows them to navigate the app freely and uncover features and functionalities on their own.

* __Scenario-based tasks:__ Provide users with specific tasks or scenarios that reflect real-world usage. These tasks should align with the app's purpose and functionalities, enabling users to engage with the application in a way that mirrors their actual experiences.

* __Realistic context:__ Set up the testing environment to resemble real-life situations as closely as possible. Use actual devices, replicate relevant background noise, or conduct the test in a setting similar to where the app would typically be used. This helps users feel more comfortable and facilitates a more authentic interaction.

* __Non-leading questions:__ When collecting feedback, ask open-ended questions that encourage users to share their genuine thoughts, opinions, and experiences without imposing any biases. Avoid leading questions that may influence or limit their responses, allowing for more unbiased feedback.

Think-aloud protocol: Encourage users to think aloud while interacting with the application. This technique allows you to gain insight into their decision-making processes, identify any challenges they encounter, and understand their overall user experience. It helps capture valuable information that may not be apparent through observation alone.

* __Observational recording:__ The interviewer should actively observe the user's interactions and record relevant observations. This includes noting their actions, behaviors, expressions, and any difficulties they face. Recording these observations in real-time ensures accurate documentation and aids in the analysis of the testing session.

We are determined to capture users' expressions, emotions, and verbal cues during each step, closely monitoring their journey through the app. Additionally, we will track the time taken by users to complete tasks, allowing us to establish comparative parameters. 

### Step 4: Post-Test Questionnaire
